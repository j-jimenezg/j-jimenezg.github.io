            <h3> About Me</h3>
            <img src= "/tarea 1/foto_jomarie.jpg" width="600" height="400">

            <p> I am a Puerto Rican student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computational Mathematics. 
            By participating in math competitions during middle school, I developed a passion for mathematics 
            from a young age. 
            </p>

            <p> My studies in Computational Mathematics consist of taking courses related to Pure Mathematics and Computer Science, 
                as well as Chemistry, Biology and Physics. Since my freshman year, I've used the skills adquired in my classes 
                in undergraduate research, with projects related to computational chemistry and engineering. 
            </p>

            <p> In graduate school, I plan to specialize in Applied Mathematics, to keep discovering the many ways in which 
                mathematics and computer programming can solve problems in fields inside and outside of the Natural Sciences.
            </p>
